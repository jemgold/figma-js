# Figma.js

A simple wrapper for the Figma API.

Cool projects using this:
- [figma-graphql](https://github.com/braposo/figma-graphql)
- [figmint](https://github.com/tiltshift/figmint)

## Usage

[Full documentation](https://jemgold.github.io/figma-js) is available on the web and most everything is typed with TypeScript.

### Creating a client

Quickest start is to grab a personal access token from your Figma account settings page

```typescript
import * as Figma from 'figma-js';

const token = '12345';

const client = Figma.Client({
  personalAccessToken: token
});
```

Or if you're building an app with OAuth authentication, after you get back the OAuth access token…

```typescript
import * as Figma from 'figma-js';

const token = '12345';

const client = Figma.Client({
  accessToken: token
});
```

Or if you need to use a https proxy agent:

```typescript
import * as Figma from 'figma-js';
import { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';

const token = '12345';
const proxyAgent = new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.https_proxy);

const client = Figma.Client({
  accessToken: token,
  httpsAgent: proxyAgent,
  proxy: false
});
```

### Doing cool things

Once you have instantiated a client, have fun!

```typescript
client.file('file-id').then(({ data }) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

### Just reusing types

All of the types in the Figma file format / API are exported.

```typescript
import * as Figma from 'figma-js';

const textNode: Figma.Text = {
  // … this should autocomplete if your editor is set up for it!
};
```
